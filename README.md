Treehouse Battleship Python Project
===================================

My run at the Treehouse Battleship project in Python.


Tests to run
------------

- Set names
- Place ships

- Don't allow both players to have the same name. 
- Don't allow a ship to be placed so that part of it is outside the grid.
